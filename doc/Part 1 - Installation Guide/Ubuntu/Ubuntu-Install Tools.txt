\page InstallUbuntuPacks Installing development tools on Ubuntu

SKIRT is written in C++11, the C++ flavor that was standardized in 2011, extending the language with new features.
The SKIRT source code resides in an online GitHub repository, which you can access from your computer
through the \c git client. Hence you need to install a recent C++ compiler and the \c git client.

On Ubuntu you can accomplish this easily by installing the appropriate packages using the standard package manager.
Open a new Terminal window:

\image html ubuntuTerminal.png
\image latex ubuntuTerminal.png

and enter the following commands:

\verbatim
sudo apt-get install g++ [ENTER]
sudo apt-get install git [ENTER]
\endverbatim

For both procedures, you will be asked for your password and prompted with the following message:

    Do you want to continue? [Y/n]

Provide your password and type Y [ENTER] where needed.
