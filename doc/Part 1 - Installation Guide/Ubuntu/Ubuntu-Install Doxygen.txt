\page InstallUbuntuDoxygen Installing the documentation generator

This section is only relevant if you wish to (re-)generate the <tt>SKIRT</tt> documentation.
The <tt>SKIRT</tt> documentation is generated from the source files by the free open source application Doxygen.
It requires the Dots tool in the Graphviz graph visualization software to generate class diagrams.

<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Installing Doxygen </b>

- Go to the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html">Doxygen download page</a>.
- Scroll down and download the binary distribution for Linux x86-64 (doxygen-1.8.8.linux.bin.tar.gz) to your Downloads folder.
- If the download is complete, open Terminal and enter the following commands to uncompress the file:

      cd [ENTER]
      cd Downloads [ENTER]
      tar xvfz doxygen-1.8.8.linux.bin.tar.gz [ENTER]

- Before doing the installation, we (strangely) have to change a configuration setting that would otherwise cause it to crash. To do this,
  navigate to the new directory "doxygen-1.8.8" in Downloads containing the uncompressed binaries in your file browser.
- Locate the file "Makefile.in" and open it in a text editor.
- In this file, <b>remove</b> the line that reads:

      $(INSTTOOL) -m 755 bin/doxytag    $(INSTALL)/bin
      
  Alternatively, precede it with a hashtag.
- Save the file and go back to Terminal.
- In your Terminal window, navigate to the "doxygen-1.8.8" directory (<tt>cd Downloads/doxygen-1.8.8</tt>) and then execute the following commands:

      ./configure [ENTER]
      sudo make install [ENTER]
      
- After that, you can check your installation by typing:

      which doxygen [ENTER]
      
  This should produce the following output:
  
      /usr/local/bin/doxygen

<b> Installing the Graphviz Graph Visualization Software </b>

- Installing Graphviz on Ubuntu is straightforward. Simply open a Terminal window and type:

      sudo apt-get install graphviz [ENTER]
      
- You can check the installation by typing the following command:

      which dot [ENTER]
      
  which should produce the following: <tt>/usr/bin/dot</tt>
