If you plan on writing or updating SKIRT code documentation, you may wish to configure DoxStyle,
a tool to assist with formatting /**-style documentation blocks in .hpp files.
DoxStyle is automatically included and built as part of the buildSKIRT project.

To configure Qt Creator so that you can easily use DoxStyle, choose the "Qt Creator->Preferences..." menu item to open
the preferences panel, and make the adjustments on the various tabs as listed below, pressing the OK button at the end.

 - "Environment -> External Tools" tab
   - Add a new category called "DoxStyle"
   - Add a new item called "Streamline Selection" to this category
   - Configure the attributes for this item as follows:
     - Description: "Streamlines the doxygen blocks in the selection"
     - Executable: path to the DoxStyle executable: ~/SKIRT/release/DoxStyle/doxstyle
     - Arguments: empty
     - Working directory: empty
     - Output: Replace Selection
     - Error output: Ignore
     - Modifies current document: off
     - Input: "%{CurrentDocument:Selection}"

 - "Environment -> Keyboard" tab
    - In the long item list, select "Tools -> External.Streamline_Selection"
    - In the "Key sequence" field, enter the shortcut combination Alt-Command-I (on Mac) or Alt-Ctrl-I (on Ubuntu)
