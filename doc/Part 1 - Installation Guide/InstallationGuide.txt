\section InstallReq System requirements

<tt>SKIRT</tt> has been developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) and on the Linux distributions Ubuntu 12.04 (64-bit) and Ubuntu 14.04 (64-bit).
However <tt>SKIRT</tt> should be able to run on any Unix system. To perform all but the smallest simulations,
it must be compiled as a 64-bit application and run on a 64-bit system.
At this time <tt>SKIRT</tt> does not properly compile or run on Microsoft Windows systems, however should the need arise this
could probably be supported with only a small effort.

<tt>SKIRT</tt> is written in C++11 and is based on the Qt 5.3 development environment. Except for MPI (which is optional), there are no other external dependencies.
The source code is hosted on GitHub. Thus you will need to install a \em git client, a recent
C++ compiler and the appropriate Qt libraries. The documentation is generated from the source code through Doxygen.
You don't need to install Doxygen and the related tools unless you are a substantial contributor to the code.

\section InstallTypes Types of installation

Subsequent sections provide detailed installation instructions for three scenarios:
 - use and/or develop on <b>Mac OS X</b>: see \subpage InstallMac
 - use and/or develop on <b>Ubuntu Desktop</b>: see \subpage InstallUbuntu
 - use (with no or minor modifications) on a <b>Unix server</b>: see \subpage InstallSource

The procedure for other scenarios, e.g. another desktop Unix flavor, can probably (hopefully) be inferred
by picking and choosing from these instructions.
