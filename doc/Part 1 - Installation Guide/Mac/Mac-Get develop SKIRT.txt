\page InstallMacGetDevelop Getting the SKIRT source code (for developers)

If you plan to make code contributions, there are two possibilities:

- You can \ref InstallMacGetDevelopPublic (if you don't have a UGent account)
- You can \ref InstallMacGetDevelopPrivate (if you have a UGent account)

\section InstallMacGetDevelopPublic Use the public SKIRT code

The public <tt>SKIRT</tt> code is hosted at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a> and always represents the most stable and thoroughly tested version of <tt>SKIRT</tt>. 
Despite not being the latest development version, developers without a UGent account are greatly encouraged to use this version as a starting point for their own contributions.
This process is effortless due to the strength of the git tool and the GitHub website. 

To setup a local repository and start developing (and using) <tt>SKIRT</tt> without a UGent account, follow the instructions below.

<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Make a GitHub account </b>

 - If you already have an account on the <a href="https://github.com">GitHub website</a>, log yourself in and skip the rest of this step.
 - Visit the <a href="https://github.com">GitHub website</a> and fill in your e-mail adress and a newly chosen username and password. 
 - Press "Sign up for GitHub". 
 - On the next page, press "Finish sign up".
 - You will receive an e-mail with a confirmation link. Go to the corresponding webpage and press "Confirm".
 - Stay logged in for the next step.

<b> Fork the <tt>SKIRT</tt> repository </b>

 - In the search bar on top of the page, type <tt>SKIRT [ENTER]</tt> to find the <tt>SKIRT</tt> repository.
 - Click on the repository that is listed as "SKIRT/SKIRT".
 - In the top right corner of the page, press "Fork" (see the screenshot below).
 - Your are immediately brought to a new repository "username/SKIRT", which is - at that moment - an exact clone of the original "SKIRT/SKIRT" repository.

<b> Configure git </b>

- Before using the git client, you should configure it with your user name and email address. This is especially important if you plan to contribute code to the <tt>SKIRT</tt>repository. 
  Perform the following commands in a Terminal window, replacing the placeholders with your own name and email address:

      git config --global user.name "Your Name" [ENTER]
      git config --global user.email "yourname@organization.org" [ENTER]
	  
<b> Clone your <tt>SKIRT</tt> fork to your computer </b>

 - In a Terminal window, type the following:
 
       cd [ENTER]
       mkdir SKIRT [ENTER]
       cd SKIRT [ENTER]
       mkdir debug doc release run git [ENTER]

 - Back on your "username/SKIRT" repository, find the "Copy to clipboard" option on the right of the page (see the screenshot below). 
 - Make sure it states "HTTPS" above the text box, before copying the link to the clipboard.

 - Go back to Terminal and type the following commands:
 
       cd [ENTER]
       cd SKIRT [ENTER]
       git clone [PASTE] git [ENTER]

   where <tt>[PASTE]</tt> is to be replaced with <tt>[CMD] + [V]</tt>. The last command thus looks as follows:
   
       git clone https://github.com/username/SKIRT.git git

   \note Don't forget to add the extra "git" at the end of the last line!
   
 - You now have your forked repository cloned to your computer, where you can begin modifying it (see the \ref DevelopersGuide).

\section InstallMacGetDevelopPrivate Use the private SKIRT code

The current development version of the <tt>SKIRT</tt> source code is stored in a \em private GitHub repository hosted
on the Ghent University's web servers. You can access this repository only if you have a UGent account \em and
the core <tt>SKIRT</tt> team has specifically granted you read-only or read/write access rights to the repository.

If you have a UGent account and the core <tt>SKIRT</tt> team has granted you access rights to the <tt>SKIRT</tt> repository, use the instructions below to obtain the <tt>SKIRT</tt> source code. 

<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Configure git </b>

- Before using the git client, you should configure it with your user name and email address. This is especially important if you plan to contribute code to the <tt>SKIRT</tt>repository. 
  Perform the following commands in a Terminal window, replacing the placeholders with your own name and email address:

      git config --global user.name "Your Name" [ENTER]
      git config --global user.email "yourname@organization.org" [ENTER]

<b> Check for existing keys </b>

- Type the following in a Terminal window:

      ls -al ~/.ssh [ENTER]

- If there is a key with extension '.pub' present, skip the next step.

<b> Generate a SSH key </b>

- Again in the Terminal window, type:

      cd [ENTER]
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "yourname@organization.org" [ENTER]
      [ENTER]

- Type a new password and press <tt>[ENTER]</tt>
- Type this password again and press <tt>[ENTER]</tt>
- You should see the following output:

      Your identification has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa.
      Your public key has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
      The key fingerprint is:
      XX:XX:XX:XX:XX ... yourname@organization.org
      The key's randomart image is:
      +--[ RSA 2048]----+
      |                 |
      |          XX     |
      |       X XX   X  |
      |         X   XX  |
      |       X XX   X  |
      |         XX XX   |
      |                 |
      |           X     |
      |                 |
      +-----------------+

<b> Add your new key to the ssh-agent </b>

- Type the following in Terminal:

      eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" [ENTER]

- You should see the following output:

      Agent pid XXXXX

- Type:

      ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa [ENTER]

- You wil see the following output:

      Enter passphrase for /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa:
	
- Enter your password and press [ENTER].
- You will see the following output:

      Identity added: /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa (/Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa)

<b> Add the SSH key to your github.ugent account </b>

- Navigate to <a href="https://github.ugent.be">github.ugent.be</a> and log in.
- Click on your username (top right).
- Click on 'Edit profile' (top right).
- Go to 'SSH keys'.
- Press 'Add SSH key'.
- As the Title, enter something that identifies your computer (for example: Personal MacBook).
- Next, go back to the terminal and copy your SSH key by typing:

      pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [ENTER]

- Back on the website, paste (<tt>[CMD] + [V]</tt>) in the 'Key' text field.
- Click 'Add key'.
- After adding your key, you should wait about 10 minutes before continuing with the next step.

<b> Clone the private repository </b>

- In a Terminal window, type the following:
 
      cd [ENTER]
      mkdir SKIRT [ENTER]
      cd SKIRT [ENTER]
      mkdir debug doc release run git [ENTER]

- Go to the <a href="https://github.ugent.be">github.ugent.be</a> webpage and log in. 
- In the search bar on top of the page, type <tt>SKIRT [ENTER]</tt> to find the <tt>SKIRT</tt> repository.
- Click on the repository that is listed as "SKIRT/SKIRT".
- On the "SKIRT/SKIRT" page, find the "Copy to clipboard" option on the right of the page (see the screenshot below). 
- Make sure it states "SSH" above the text box, before copying the link to the clipboard.

- Go back to Terminal and type the following commands:
 
      cd [ENTER]
      cd SKIRT [ENTER]
      git clone [PASTE] git [ENTER]

  where <tt>[PASTE]</tt> is to be replaced with <tt>[CMD] + [V]</tt>. The last command thus looks as follows:
   
      git clone git@github.ugent.be:SKIRT/SKIRT.git git

  \note Don't forget to add the extra "git" at the end of the last line!

- You will see the following output:

      The authenticity of host 'github.ugent.be (XXX.XXX.XXX.XX)' can't be established. 
      RSA key fingerprint is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX ... .
      Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 

- Type:

      yes [ENTER]

- You will see different kinds of output.
- To update your local copy of the source code after changes were made to the repository from which you cloned it, use:

      cd ~/SKIRT/git [ENTER]
      git pull [ENTER]

- You now have a local repository (\em local meaning 'on your own computer') which is a clone of the remote repository
  (\em remote meaning that it is located on the web). 
- You can begin modifying the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code as explained in the \ref DevelopersGuide,
  and make commits as explained on the \ref DevGit page. However, to actually get your changes in the remote repository, you will need to fork
  the private repository on the github.ugent.be website. This is explained in the next step.

<b> Create your own fork the private <tt>SKIRT</tt> repository </b>

- Go back to the "SKIRT/SKIRT" page on github.ugent.be.
- In the top right corner of the page, press "Fork" (see the screenshot below).
- Your are immediately brought to a new repository "username/SKIRT", which is - at that moment - an exact clone of the original "SKIRT/SKIRT" repository.
 
\image html SKIRTpublicrepository.png
\image latex SKIRTpublicrepository.png

- The new (forked) remote repository, which is personal to your account, allows you to store the changes that you made locally on the github.ugent.be website. 
  Since the remote is personal, only you can write to it. Still, you can request for the <tt>SKIRT</tt> team to incorporate the changes in your personal remote into
  the original <tt>SKIRT</tt> remote. This is called a "pull request". How to perform such a request is explained below.

- To be able to push to your forked remote, you first need to tell git where it is. To do this, go to the "username/SKIRT" repository 
  on the github.ugent.be website and copy the SSH link to your clipboard. 
  
  \image html githubsshlink.png
  \image latex githubsshlink.png
  
- Next, type the following commands in a Terminal window:

      cd ~/SKIRT/git [ENTER]
      git remote add personal [PASTE] [ENTER]

  where <tt>[PASTE]</tt> is to be replaced with <tt>[CMD] + [V]</tt>. The last command thus looks as follows:
  
      git remote add personal git@github.ugent.be:username/SKIRT.git
      
  This command adds your personal remote to the list of remotes related to your local repository. It gives this remote the alias "personal", which is how
  how you will refer to this remote when you are pushing changes. The original private <tt>SKIRT</tt> remote that you cloned from is automatically given the 
  alias "origin". A list of the remotes linked to your local repository is obtained with the following command:
  
      git remote [ENTER]

  The output of this command should state the names of the two remote repositories.
  
- Your <tt>SKIRT</tt> repository is all set up! You can now also push your changes to the remote "personal". To do this, use the following command:

      git push personal master [ENTER]
      
  Where "master" is the name of the main branch of your local repository. You don't need to add any more branches, but if you would like to do this you can 
  read \ref DevGitCreateBranch.
