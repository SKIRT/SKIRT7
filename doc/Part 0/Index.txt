<tt>SKIRT</tt> is a state-of-the-art software code for simulating continuum radiation transfer in dusty astrophysical systems,
such as galaxies and accretion disks. <tt>SKIRT</tt> employs the Monte Carlo technique to emulate the relevant physical
processes including scattering, absorption and emission by the dust. The code features a wealth of built-in geometries,
light source spectra, dust characterizations, dust grids, and detectors, in addition to various mechanisms for
importing models generated by hydrodynamical simulations. The configuration for a particular simulation is defined
at either at runtime with a user-friendly command-line interface, or with a graphical interface called <tt>SKIRT MakeUp</tt>.

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> manual is structured as follows:

<b> Part I: Guides -- provides overall guidance and tutorials. </b>

  - The \ref InstallationGuide describes how to install <tt>SKIRT</tt> and its dependencies on your computer.
  - The \ref UsersGuide explains how to prepare and run a <tt>SKIRT</tt> or <tt>FitSKIRT</tt> simulation and what output to expect.
  - The \ref DevelopersGuide offers guidelines on how to extend or adjust the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code.

<b> Part II: Concepts -- offers extra information on selected topics. </b>

  - \ref Parallelization explains in detail how <tt>SKIRT</tt> is adapted for parallel computing.
  - \ref DustProp describes how <tt>SKIRT</tt> deals with optical and calorimetric dust properties.
  - \ref Hydro presents <tt>SKIRT</tt>'s capabilities for working with the results of hydrodynamical simulations.
  - \ref SpatialGrids introduces the spatial grids used for discretizing the dusty medium in <tt>SKIRT</tt>.
  - \ref Polarization describes the implementation of polarized radiation transfer in <tt>SKIRT</tt>.
  - \ref PerInstr provides details on <tt>SKIRT</tt>'s perspective instrument, used mostly for making movies.
  - \ref Cfitsio introduces the library included with <tt>SKIRT</tt> to read and write FITS files.
  - \ref voro introduces the library included with <tt>SKIRT</tt> to construct Voronoi tesselations.
  - \ref GAlib introduces the library included with <tt>FitSKIRT</tt> to search the model parameter space.

<b> Part III: Reference -- documents every class, namespace and function. </b>

  - Select the "Namespaces" tab at the top to get a list of the different namespaces in the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code. The "Namespace Members" subtab gives a list
    of all the functions enclosed in namespaces.
  - Select the "Classes" tab at the top to obtain a list of all the classes and structures in <tt>SKIRT</tt>. Select the "Class Index" subtab to search
    for classes alphabetically. The "Class Hierarchy" subtab brings you to a graphical representation of the relations between all classes.
    The "Class Members" subtab provides a list of all member functions.
