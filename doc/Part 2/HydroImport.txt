\page Hydro Importing snapshots from hydrodynamical simulations

\section HydroIntro Introduction

Analytical or quasi-analytical models often fall short in describing the geometric complexity of the real world. More
realistic numerical models can be produced by computer programs that simulate the (magneto-)hydrodynamical evolution of
an astrophysical system over time. Such codes usually output a series of \em snapshots. The data provided in each
snapshot define the state of the simulated system at a particular time in its evolution, including the spatial
distribution and other relevant properties of the dynamical components, such as for example the stars and the
interstellar medium in a galaxy.

Because of the nonlocal and nonlinear behavior of the radiative transfer (RT) problem, predicting the observable
properties of these hydrodynamical models requires a full 3D RT simulation in all but the most trivial cases. Assuming
that the radiation crossing times are much shorter than the dynamical time scales, and that radiation pressure is
negligible, the RT and hydrodynamical simulations can be completely uncoupled. In other words, the RT simulation can
then be performed as a \em post-processing step based solely on the information contained in a particular snapshot. The
RT code extracts the spatial distribution of the radiation sources (e.g., stars) and the obscuring medium (e.g., dust),
plus the corresponding properties, from the hydrodynamical snapshot data, and then performs a RT simulation on the
resulting setup.

The radiation sources and the obscuring medium are obviously handled differently during a Monte Carlo RT simulation,
implying different needs for the corresponding data structures. The most frequent demand on the data structure
representing the radiation sources (\ref HydroSources) is to generate a photon package launch position that is randomly
sampled from the luminosity distribution at a given wavelength. This operation usually occurs millions or even billions
of times during a single simulation, and thus should execute fairly quickly. On the other hand, the key operation for
the dusty medium (\ref HydroDust) is to determine the dust density at a given location, or the dust mass in a given
volume. These functions are needed while constructing the dust grid, i.e. for deciding where to subdivide cells in
adaptive grids, and for calculating the dust mass in each cell of the final dust grid. Although this is an intensive
process, it is limited to the setup phase of the simulation, because, once constructed, the dust grid includes all
information required for tracing photon packages through the spatial domain.

Hydrodynamical simulation codes historically employ one of two schemes: a Lagrangian formulation based on moving
particles (smoothed particle hydrodynamics or SPH), for example Gadget and Gasoline; or a Eulerian approach based on a
non-moving spatial grid, often an adaptive grid with multiple refinement levels (AMR), for example RAMSES, Enzo, and
AMR-VAC. Recent codes including AREPO, TESS, and Shadowfax introduce a new scheme that employs a moving mesh based on a
Voronoi tessellation of the spatial domain. This new scheme is claimed to combine the best features of SPH and the
traditional Eulerian approach, and it is becoming increasingly popular.

In this note we discuss SKIRT's mechanisms for importing distributions of radiation sources (\ref HydroSources) and
dust (\ref HydroDust) from snapshots produced by each of these three schemes. The final section (\ref HydroConclusions)
offers some conclusions.


\section HydroSources Radiation sources

A SKIRT simulation always includes one or more stellar components describing the radiation sources in the model (see
the StellarSystem and StellarComp classes). Each stellar component defines (a) the spatial density distribution of the
sources and (b) the spectral energy distribution (%SED) at each location. In the context of post-processing
hydrodynamical simulations, there are three distinct ways of accomplishing this:

- The imported snapshot defines the spatial density distribution and provides additional properties for each smoothed
particle or grid cell from which an appropriate %SED can be determined. For this purpose, SKIRT includes two
parameterized %SED families. The Bruzual-Charlot family (the BruzualCharlotSEDFamily class) represents young and
evolved stellar populations. The Mappings III %SED family (the MappingsSEDFamily class) represents star-forming
regions. More families can be added with minimal programming effort, provided the data for the %SED templates is
available in analytical or tabulated form.

- The imported snapshot defines just the spatial density distribution, and a particular %SED (constant throughout the
spatial domain) is configured from the %SED components built into SKIRT (subclasses of the StellarSED class).

- The radiation sources are completely defined within SKIRT by configuring a built-in geometry (subclasses of the
Geometry class) and %SED (subclasses of the StellarSED class). In case a hydrodynamical simulation does not include any
sources, this option can be used to complete the RT model by adding, for example, a central star to a stellar dust
disk, or background radiation to the dust in a molecular cloud.

One can even combine these options by using two different stellar components, for example, for adding an active
galactic nucleus to a spiral galaxy snapshot.

\subsection HydroSourcesSph Smoothed particles

In spite of claims that the technique suffers from fundamental problems, SPH is still a popular hydrodynamics
technique, especially for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. An SPH snapshot consists of a set of \em
particles (or rather anchor points in a co-moving grid), each characterized by a large suite of physical quantities, of
which only a selected few are relevant for SKIRT. Rather than attempting to support a wide variety of file formats,
SKIRT reads the properties for a list of SPH particles from a text file in a simple format that can be easily generated
by a conversion script, for example in a programming language such as Python. As an added benefit, this allows
additional processing such as unit conversions to occur along the way.

The spatial luminosity distribution in an SPH snapshot is defined by a list of \f$N\f$ smoothed particles and an
assumed smoothing kernel \f$W(r,h)\f$, with each smoothed particle characterized by a position \f$\mathbf{r}_j\f$, a
smoothing length \f$h_j\f$, and a luminosity contribution \f$L_j\f$. The total luminosity density at an arbitrary
position \f$\mathbf{r}\f$ is then given by \f[ \Sigma(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{j=1}^N L_j \,
W(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_j|,h_j) \f]

In practice, the kernels used in SPH simulations almost always have a finite support so that only a relatively small
number of terms in the sum have a non-zero contribution. SKIRT employs smoothing kernel implementations optimized for
each specific task. For shooting photon packages, the code needs to generate random launch positions sampled from the
radiation source's density distribution. This is rather straightforward in this case, thanks to the composition method.
The first step is the choice of a random smoothed particle, based on a discrete distribution where each particle is
weighted by its relative luminosity contribution. The second step is generating a random position according to the
luminosity distribution of the chosen particle. Although it is in principle possible to sample from any kernel using
tabulated values, SKIRT samples a random position from a scaled Gaussian smoothing kernel, \f[ W(r,h) =
\frac{a^3}{\pi^{3/2}\,h^3} \,\exp({-\frac{a^2 r^2}{h^2}}) \f] with the value of the scaling factor set to
\f$a=2.42\approx2\pi^{1/6}\f$. Sampling from a Gaussian kernel can be implemented easily using the inversion method.
For consistency, the value of \f$a\f$ has been chosen so that the scaled Gaussian kernel approximates (within a few per
cent across the domain) the cubic spline kernel which is used in SKIRT for determining dust densities (see \ref
HydroDustSph).

\subsubsection HydroSourcesSphSnapsed Spatial distribution and SED from snapshot

We first consider the case where both the spatial distribution and the %SED at each location are determined from the
SPH snapshot. The SPHStellarComp class in SKIRT expects a text file with a single line for each SPH particle. The first
four columns specify the \f$x\f$, \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$ coordinates and the smoothing length \f$h\f$ for the particle
(all in parsec). The number and interpretation of the subsequent columns depends on the %SED family configured for this
SPHStellarComp instance.

For the Bruzual-Charlot %SED family (BruzualCharlotSEDFamily), the remaining three columns provide the properties of
the stellar population represented by the particle. The first extra column specifies the initial mass of the stellar
population, i.e. the particle's mass \f$M_\mathrm{init}\f$ at the time it was born (in \f$\mathrm{M}_\odot\f$). The
second extra column specifies the metallicity \f$Z\f$ of the stellar population (as a dimensionless fraction), and the
third extra column represents the age \f$t\f$ of the stellar population (in years).

For the Mappings III %SED family (MappingsSEDFamily), the remaining five columns provide the properties of the
star-bursting region represented by the particle, in the following order: the star formation rate \f$\dot{M}\f$,
assumed to be constant over the past 10 Myr (in \f$\mathrm{M}_\odot\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}\f$); the metallicity \f$Z\f$
(as a dimensionless fraction); the logarithm of the compactness \f$\log C\f$ (dimensionless); the pressure of the
surrounding medium \f$p\f$ (in Pa); and the photo-dissociation-region covering factor \f$f_{\mathrm{PDR}}\f$
(dimensionless).

Using these properties as parameters for the appropriate set of built-in %SED templates, SKIRT calculates the
luminosity contribution \f$(L_j)_\ell\f$ of each particle for each wavelength bin \f$\ell\f$ in the simulation's
wavelength grid. This information is stored in memory during setup, and is used during the Monte Carlo cycle to
determine the (wavelength-dependent) probability that a given particle will be selected as the launch site for a new
photon package.

\subsubsection HydroSourcesSphVelocity Velocity and Doppler shift

The SPHStellarComp class can be configured to take into account the Doppler shift caused by the velocity of the
radiation sources relative to the center of mass of the system. If this option is enabled, the input text file must
provide three additional columns (after the smoothing length and before the additional properties for the %SED family),
specifying the \f$v_\mathrm{x}\f$, \f$v_\mathrm{y}\f$ and \f$v_\mathrm{z}\f$ components of the particle's velocity (in
km/s). Given this velocity \f$\mathbf{v}\f$, the redshift \f$z\f$ experienced by a photon package launched from the
particle in direction \f$\mathbf{k}\f$ (given as a unit vector) is determined by \f[ z =
-\frac{\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{k}}{c} \f] where \f$c\f$ is the speed of light in vacuum. In function of the rest
wavelength \f$\lambda_0\f$, the redshifted wavelength \f$\lambda_z\f$ is given by \f$\lambda_z=(1+z)\,\lambda_0\f$. For
\f$z\ll1\f$, the observed luminosity at each wavelength in the simulation's wavelength grid can then be written as
\f$L_z[\lambda_\ell] = L_0[(1-z)\,\lambda_\ell]\f$.

Since the redshift value depends on the angle between the particle and photon package trajectories, the emission is no
longer isotropic. When launching a photon package from a given particle, the Monte Carlo code must randomly pick a
direction from a non-uniform distribution. To this end, we express the photon package's direction in spherical
coordinates \f$(\theta,\phi)\f$ relative to a polar axis along the particle's trajectory. While the azimuth \f$\phi\f$
is still distributed uniformly, the probability distribution of the polar angle \f$\theta\f$ for wavelength bin
\f$\ell\f$ is determined by the form of the %SED assigned to the particle in the wavelength range
\f$[(1-v/c)\,\lambda_\ell, (1+v/c)\,\lambda_\ell]\f$, where \f$v=||\mathbf{v}||\f$ is the magnitude of the particle's
velocity. The need to store this distribution at an acceptable resolution of, say, 1 degree in \f$\theta\f$, for each
particle and for each wavelength bin substantially boosts memory requirements. Otherwise the implementation is fairly
straightforward.

\subsubsection HydroSourcesSphBuiltsed Spatial distribution from snapshot with built-in SED

If the hydrodynamical simulation does not track the relevant properties for defining the local emission spectrum, we
can still import the spatial luminosity distribution from the snapshot and assign a built-in %SED that is constant
across the spatial domain. In this case, we use the GeometricStellarComp class, and we configure it with an instance of
the SPHGeometry class to import the snapshot. Similar to the SPHStellarComp class described in \ref
HydroSourcesSphSnapsed, the SPHGeometry class expects a text file with a single line for each SPH particle. The first
four columns specify the \f$x\f$, \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$ coordinates and the smoothing length \f$h\f$ for the particle
(all in parsec). The product of the values in the fifth and sixth columns specifies the density contribution of this
particle, in arbitrary units since the SPHGeometry class normalizes the total weight of the density distribution to
unity. (The definition uses two columns for compatibility with dust density distributions; see \ref
HydroDustSphLoadsnap).

Because the SPHGeometry class normalizes the spatial distribution to unity, we need to separately supply the actual
luminosity of the source through one of the standard normalization options offered in SKIRT. Because the %SED is
constant across the spatial domain, it is sufficient to set, for example, the luminosity at one particular wavelength.

\subsection HydroSourcesAmr Hierarchical grids

Apart from smoothed particle hydrodynamics, the main other technique that is used to perform hydrodynamics simulations
is Eulerian mesh-based hydrodynamics. A fundamental ingredient of this technique is the use of adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR), where the hierarchical grid is adjusted depending on the resolution requirements in various regions of the
model. While the resolution requirements and thus the AMR grid may change as the system evolves, each particular
snapshot corresponds to a unique and well-defined hierarchical grid. The SKIRT class names and documentation do not
properly make this distinction and use the terms \em AMR, \em adaptive \em mesh and \em hierarchical \em grid
interchangeably.

A hierarchical grid can be defined using spherical or cylindrical coordinates, perhaps to benefit from certain
quasi-symmetries in the model, however, we will limit the discussion here to grids using Cartesian coordinates. In a
Cartesian hierarchical grid, the cuboidal spatial domain is recursively subdivided into smaller cuboids according to
some scheme until the desired resolution in each area is reached. Thus, an AMR snapshot includes some description of
the structure of the hierarchical grid, implicitly or explicitly defining the spatial extent of each grid cell, and for
each cell the values of a suite of physical quantities of which only a selected few are relevant for SKIRT.

\subsubsection HydroSourcesAmrSnapshot Snapshot data format

SKIRT can directly read the binary data format generated by the mesh-based MPI-AMRVAC code developed by Keppens et al.
The specifics of this import mechanism are described in the documentation for the AdaptiveMeshAmrvacFile class and
related classes. In this section we discuss a more general import mechanism based on a plain text file format
specifically designed for this purpose. For most mesh-based snapshots (including the MPI-AMRVAC snapshots), writing a
conversion script to generate this format should be rather straightforward.

The text file format we designed (see the AdaptiveMeshFile and AdaptiveMeshAsciiFile classes) describes the structure
of the hierarchical grid and lists the relevant physical properties in each cell. In other words, a file in this format
represents one or more scalar fields over a given cubodial spatial domain (assuming Cartesian coordinates) which is
recursively subdivided into cuboidal cells. The size of the spatial domain, the meaning of the fields, and the units in
which the values are expressed, must be defined elsewhere (i.e. this information is not part of the data format
itself).

The hierarchical grid structure is organized into a tree. Each tree node represents a cuboidal portion of the domain,
called its \em extent. The \em root node's extent is the complete domain. A \em nonleaf node distributes its extent
over its child nodes using a regular linear grid. The number of subdivisions is defined separately for each node and
can differ for each spatial dimension. An octree, for example, would subdivide each nonleaf node into
\f$2\times2\times2\f$ child nodes. Typical AMR schemes have much larger subdivision counts that sometimes vary within
the grid; for example, the root node may be subdivided differently. A \em leaf node represents a cell that is not
subdivided any further and that holds a data value for each field; the field values are considered to be constant over
the leaf node's extent. Collectively the leaf nodes form a partition of the domain, i.e. their extents cover the
complete domain without overlapping one another.

The leaf nodes or cells in this three-dimensional data structure can be arranged in a linear sequence using so-called
\em Morton \em ordering. This ordering is obtained by performing a depth-first traversal of the tree, where each
nonleaf node visits its children in the order x-first, then y, then z. The process is illustrated in the following
figure for a two-dimensional structure. The root node is subdivided into \f$4\times3\f$ subnodes; some of the nodes
near the center are subdivided into \f$2\times2\f$ subnodes, and two of the cells in the upper row are subdivided into
\f$1\times2\f$ subnodes. The solid line connects the leaf nodes in Morton order, starting at the lower left node with
Morton index 0 and performing a depth-first traversal with each nonleaf node visiting its children in the order first x
(horizontal) and then y (vertical).

\image latex HydroMortonGrid.png

The overall makeup of the snapshot text file reflects this structure and ordering. Below is a text representation of
the 2D grid shown in the above figure. Because SKIRT deals with 3D grids, we've added a third dimension that is never
subdivided. The lines starting with an exclamation mark indicate a subdivided node, e.g., the root node is subdivided
in \f$4\times3\times1\f$ cells. The other lines specify the field values for a particular cell. In this example, the
first field value specifies the serial number or \em Morton \em index of the cell, and the second value specifies the
cell's "density" reflected by the gray level in the above figure. In an actual snapshot, these illustrative values
would be replaced by the relevant physical quantities.

\verbatim
# Snapshot text data file
! 4 3 1
0 0.4
1 0.4
2 0.4
3 0.4
4 0.4
! 2 2 1
5 0.6
6 0.6
7 0.6
! 2 2 1
8 0.8
9 0.8
10 0.8
11 0.8

18 0.5
19 0.5
! 1 2 1
20 0.5
21 0.5
22 0.4
\endverbatim

More formally, each line in the text file describes a particular tree node (nonleaf or leaf), and the lines are given
in Morton order. Specifically, each line in the file can be of one of the following types:

- \em Comment: lines having a number sign or hash (\#) as the first non-whitespace character, lines containing only
whitespace and empty lines are ignored (and do not count in the Morton order).

- \em Nonleaf: a nonleaf line has an exclamation mark (!) as the first non-whitespace character, followed by optional
whitespace and then three whitespace-separated positive integer numbers \f$N_x,N_y,N_z\f$. These three numbers specify
the number of child nodes carried by this node in each spatial direction. The child nodes are on a regular linear grid
as described above.

- \em Leaf: a leaf node contains one or more whitespace-separated floating point numbers, specifying the values of the
fields in the cell represented by this leaf node. All leaf node lines in the file must contain the same number of field
values.

Note that there is no need to provide the cell positions because the geometry follows from the Morton order (and the
total domain size, which is passed to SKIRT independently of the snapshot file).

\subsubsection HydroSourcesAmrSnapsed Spatial distribution and SED from snapshot

As before, we first consider the case where both the spatial distribution and the %SED at each location are determined
from the snapshot. The AdaptiveMeshStellarComp class in SKIRT expects a snapshot data file in the format described
above, supplemented with the size of the spatial domain in each direction, because that information is not stored in
the file. In addition, the user must configure which of the scalar fields in the snapshot file carry the relevant
physical quantities for determining the %SED assigned to each cell.

The current implementation supports just the Bruzual-Charlot %SED family, so the AdaptiveMeshStellarComp class expects
three values, respectively specifying the initial stellar density \f$\rho_\mathrm{init}\f$ (in
\f$\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\f$), the metallicity \f$Z\f$ of the stellar population (dimensionless fraction),
and the age \f$t\f$ of the stellar population (in years). Using these properties as parameters for the Bruzual-Charlot
%SED templates, SKIRT calculates the luminosity contribution of each cell for each wavelength bin. This information is
used during the Monte Carlo cycle to determine the (wavelength-dependent) probability that a given cell will be
selected as the launch site for a new photon package. Generating a random launch position from a uniform distribution
within the selected cuboidal cell is of course trivial.

When the need arises, we can add support for other %SED families, similar to what was described for the SPHStellarComp
class dealing with SPH snapshots in \ref HydroSourcesSphSnapsed.

\subsubsection HydroSourcesAmrBuiltsed Spatial distribution from snapshot with built-in SED

Similar to the procedure described for SPH snapshots in \ref HydroSourcesSphBuiltsed, we can import the spatial
luminosity distribution from a mesh-based snapshot and assign a built-in %SED that is constant across the spatial
domain. In this case, we configure an instance of the AdaptiveMeshGeometry class to import the snapshot, separately
specifying the extent of the spatial domain as before. The density contribution of each cell is given by the product of
two field values with configurable indices, for compatibility with dust density distributions; see \ref
HydroDustGridLoadsnap. Because the AdaptiveMeshGeometry class normalizes the spatial distribution to unity, we need to
separately supply the actual luminosity of the source through one of the standard normalization options offered in
SKIRT.

\subsection HydroSourcesVoro Voronoi grids

Recently, a new Lagrangian technique that solves the hydrodynamics equations on a moving, unstructured Voronoi grid is
gaining popularity. It is claimed to avoid some of the difficulties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics on the one hand
and Eulerian grid-based hydrodynamics on the other hand. Moving mesh hydrodynamics is mainly applied to simulations of
galaxy formation and evolution.

Due to the nature of a Voronoi tesselation, the geometry of the grid is completely defined by the positions of the
generating sites. It is hence not necessary for a snapshot to store all the vertices and edges of each of the cells.
Similar to our approach for other snapshot types, SKIRT reads the properties for a list of Voronoi cells from a text
file in a simple format that can be easily generated by a conversion script. SKIRT constructs the Voronoi grid from the
positions of the generating sites, and assigns the corresponding physical values to each cell, assuming that the values
are constant across the cell's extent.

\subsubsection HydroSourcesVoroLaunch Launching photon packages

The generation of random positions for launching photon packages is similar to the procedure for hierarchical grids. In
the first step, we pick a random cell using a discrete distribution where each cell is weighted by its relative
(possibly wavelength-dependent) luminosity contribution. The second step, generating a random position from within the
chosen cell, is significantly more complex than in the case of a cuboidal cell. To the best of our knowledge, there are
no dedicated techniques to generate a random point from a Voronoi cell. There are two possible options.

The first option is to partition the cell into a set of tetrahedra, subsequently select a random tetrahedron from a
discrete distribution where every tetrahedron is weighted by its relative volume, and finally generate a random
position from the selected tetrahedron. Specific algorithms are available for both the tetrahedrization of convex
polyhedra and the generation of random positions from a tetrahedron.

The second option, which is more straightforward and which we adopted in SKIRT, is to use the rejection technique. As
the reference distribution we use a uniform density in a cuboidal volume, defined as the 3D bounding box of the cell.
During construction of the Voronoi grid, for each cell, we store the cell bounding box (easily obtained from the cell
vertices because Voronoi cells are convex polyhedra) and a list of all neighboring cells. After generating a candidate
random position uniformly from the cell bounding box, we decide whether the position is actually inside the Voronoi
cell by checking that it is closer to the cell's generating site than to the generating sites of all its neighbors.

Our tests have shown that, depending on the distribution of the generating Voronoi sites, the average ratio of the
volume of the bounding box of a Voronoi cell over the actual cell volume is about 3 to 4. This ratio represents the
average rejection rate for the random position generation.

\subsubsection HydroSourcesVoroLoadsnap Loading snapshots

The procedures for loading a spatial and/or spectral distribution from a Voronoi-tesselation-based snapshot into SKIRT
are very similar to what was described for the other snapshot types in \ref HydroSourcesSph and \ref HydroSourcesAmr.

The VoronoiStellarComp class expects a snapshot data file in a straightforward text column format, containing one line
per cell. The first three columns provide the \f$x\f$, \f$y\f$, and \f$z\f$ coordinates of the generating site for the
cell, and the subsequent columns specify the relevant physical quantities for determining the %SED assigned to each
cell. The current implementation supports just the Bruzual-Charlot %SED family, so the class expects three values
specifying the initial stellar density, the metallicity of the stellar population, and the age of the stellar
population. The order in which these are specified can be configured by the user.

The VoronoiGeometry class imports just the spatial luminosity distribution from a Voronoi-based snapshot, allowing to
separately assign a built-in %SED that is constant across the spatial domain. The file format is similar as described
above, however the density contribution of each Voronoi cell is now given by the product of two field values with
configurable indices. Because the class normalizes the spatial distribution to unity, we need to separately supply the
actual luminosity of the source through one of the standard normalization options offered in SKIRT.


\section HydroDust Dust properties

Apart from radiation sources, any nontrivial SKIRT simulation also includes a \em dust \em system with one or more \em
dust \em components describing the dusty medium in the model (see the DustSystem and DustComp classes). Each dust
component defines (a) the spatial density distribution of the dust and (b) the relevant material properties of the
dust. In addition, a dust system also configures a \em dust \em grid that will be used to discretize the dusty medium
for the purposes of the RT simulation (see the DustGrid class and it suclasses). We will discuss each of these aspects
in turn.

SKIRT offers two distinct ways to define the dust density distribution:

- The imported snapshot fully defines the dust density distribution, either directly or as a simple formula in function
of the properties of the gas density as explained in \ref HydroDustSph. With this option, the dust system is configured
with an instance of one of the SPHDustDistribution, AdaptiveMeshDustDistribution, or VoronoiDustDistribution classes.
The latter two classes allow configuring multiple dust components (each with their own distribution and dust
properties) to be loaded from the same snapshot.

- The dust density distribution is defined by configuring one or more built-in geometries through the
CompDustDistribution class using any of the subclasses of the Geometry class, including at least one instance of the
SPHGeometry, AdaptiveMeshGeometry, or VoronoiGeometry classes. With this option, it is possible to assigning separate
dust properties to each of the components, and to combine quasi-analytic dust geometries with densities loaded from a
snapshot.

Each of the dust components configured as described above must be assigned a specific \em dust \em mixture, which
defines the optical and calorimetric properties of the dust grains (see the DustMix class and its subclasses, and also
\ref DustProp). The dust properties are considered to be constant across the spatial domain of the dust component, but
evidently different dust components can be assigned different dust mixtures.

Note that the stellar system and the dust system each have their own distinct import mechanism. It is perfectly
possible to import, say, radiation sources from SPH particles and dust densities from an AMR grid. Such a combination
is not uncommon. The RAMSES code, for example, can use an N-body solver for the pressure-less dark matter and stellar
particles while employing a mesh-based hydrodynamical solver for the gas medium in the same simulation.

Finally, a dust grid must be properly configured to provide adequate spatial resolution in areas with high dust
densities or large density gradients. When importing a hydrodynamical simulation snapshot, the best option is to select
an adaptive grid, such as a hierarchical octree grid (OctTreeDustGrid), a k-d tree grid (BinTreeDustGrid), or a Voronoi
grid (VoronoiDustGrid). To help evaluate and configure the quality of a dust grid, it is instructive to review the dust
density cuts along the coordinate planes generated by SKIRT upon request (see the documentation of the DustSystem
class). The \em theoretical density maps shows the dust density as it is defined through one of the DustDistribution
classes, while the \em gridded density shows the dust density after discretization in the dust grid.

\subsection HydroDustSph Smoothed particles

The mechanisms for loading the dust density from an SPH snapshot are similar to those discussed in \ref HydroSourcesSph
for radiation sources. There are, however, some differences and additional considerations. The total dust density at an
arbitrary position is obtained through \f[ \rho(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{j=1}^N M_j \, W(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_j|,h_j) \f]
where \f$M_j\f$ now indicates the dust mass contribution for each particle. This value may simply be provided in the
snapshot as a particle property, but just as likely, the hydrodynamical simulation traces the evolution of the gas
medium as a whole rather than the dust per se. To facilitate those cases, SKIRT can calculate the dust mass from the
gas mass in the input data, assuming that the amount of dust is proportional to the metal fraction in the gas, except
in areas where the gas is too hot to form dust. In other words, dropping the particle index, we have \f[
M_\mathrm{dust} = \begin{cases} f_\mathrm{dust}\,Z\,M_\mathrm{gas} & \mathrm{if}\; T<T_\mathrm{max} \\ 0 &
\mathrm{otherwise} \end{cases} \f] where \f$M_\mathrm{gas}\f$, \f$Z\f$, and \f$T\f$ are the gas mass, metallicity, and
temperature given by the gas particle's properties in the snapshot, and \f$f_\mathrm{dust}\f$ and \f$T_\mathrm{max}\f$
are constant parameters specified when configuring SKIRT. A fixed dust-to-metal fraction \f$f_\mathrm{dust}\f$ is
widely assumed to be an appropriate approximation for a variety of environments, although observed values range from
\f$f_\mathrm{dust}=0.2\f$ to \f$0.4\f$. If the cutoff temperature \f$T_\mathrm{max}\f$ is set to zero, the temperature
criterion is ignored and the gas temperature does not need to be specified in the snapshot data.

As already mentioned in \ref HydroSourcesSph, SKIRT employs implementations for the smoothing kernel \f$W(r,h)\f$ that
are optimized for each specific task. To calculate the dust density at a given location, SKIRT uses the cubic spline
kernel \f[ W(r,h) = \frac{8}{\pi\,h^3} \times \begin{cases} 1 - 6\,u^2\,(1-u) & \mathrm{for}\;0<u<\tfrac12 \\
2\,(1-u)^3 & \mathrm{for}\;\tfrac12<u<1 \\ 0 & \mathrm{otherwise} \end{cases} \f] with \f$u=r/h\f$ (see the class
SPHGasParticle). This kernel has a finite support so that the operation can be limited to particles that potentially
overlap the location of interest. To facilitate this process, the setup phase of the simulation places a rough grid
over the spatial domain and constructs a list of overlapping particles for each grid cell.

A further optimization is provided in the class SPHGasParticle to calculate the mass within a given box (a cuboid lined
up with the coordinate axes), as an alternative to sampling the density in various locations across the volume of the
box. In this case, the calculation uses the analytical properties of the scaled and clipped Gaussian kernel defined in
\ref HydroSourcesSph, which was designed to approximate the cubic spline kernel, to directly determine the mass in the
box. The advantage of this kernel is that the integration over a box can be written in terms of the error function,

\f[

Assuming the error function can be calculated quickly or, more likely, is tabulated at sufficient resolution, this
optimization accelerates the density calculation for typical Cartesian grids by an order of magnitude.

\subsubsection HydroDustSphLoadsnap Loading snapshots

The SPHDustDistribution class expects a text file in a format similar to what was described in \ref
HydroSourcesSphSnapsed for radiation sources. Again, the first four columns specify the \f$x\f$, \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$
coordinates and the smoothing length \f$h\f$ for each particle (all in parsec). The subsequent columns now specify the
gas mass \f$M_\mathrm{gas}\f$ (in \f$\mathrm{M}_\odot\f$), metallicity \f$Z\f$ (dimensionless fraction) and temperature
\f$T\f$ (in K). The last column is optional; if the temperature value is missing, the particle is considered to contain
dust regardless of the temperature cutoff value \f$T_\mathrm{max}\f$.

We can also configure the CompDustDistribution class with an an instance of the SPHGeometry class. The text file
expected by this class has the same format as the one expected by the SPHDustDistribution class. However, the
SPHGeometry class normalizes the total weight of the density distribution to unity, which means that we need to supply
the total dust mass through one of the standard normalization mechanisms offered by SKIRT. Note that the SPHGeometry
class can also be configured as part of a stellar system (see \ref HydroSourcesSphBuiltsed). In that case, the values
in the fifth and sixth columns no longer have the meaning of mass and metallicity, and their product simply defines the
relative luminosity contribution.

\subsection HydroDustGrid Hierarchical grids and Voronoi grids

The SKIRT classes for importing grid-based snapshots currently do not implement the temperature cutoff criterion
described in \ref HydroDustSph. For each cell in the grid, the dust density is thus simply calculated according to \f[
\rho_\mathrm{dust} = f_\mathrm{dust}\,Z\,\rho_\mathrm{gas} \f] where \f$\rho_\mathrm{gas}\f$ and \f$Z\f$ are the gas
density and metallicity given by the cell properties in the snapshot, and \f$f_\mathrm{dust}\f$ is a constant parameter
specified when configuring SKIRT. In case the hydrodynamical simulation directly traces a dust population, we can
configure SKIRT to use \f$f_\mathrm{dust}=1\f$ and to ignore metallicity (effectively setting \f$Z=1\f$ as well).

Determining the dust density at an arbitrary position comes down to identifying the cell that contains that position
and returning the density associated with this cell. For a hierarchical grid this entails a simple search that starts
at the root node and recursively descends into the child node that happens to contain the given position until a leaf
node has been reached. With the cuboidal cells in a Cartesian grid this is rather straightforward. In the case of a
Voronoi grid, however, the cell identification is not as simple. Due to the nature of Voronoi grids, locating the
appropriate cell is essentially a nearest neighbor search. Rather than looping over all possible cells (or
equivalently, all generating sites), SKIRT implements an approach using cuboidal blocks (see the VoronoiMesh class).

\subsubsection HydroDustGridLoadsnap Loading snapshots

The file formats expected by the AdaptiveMeshDustDistribution and VoronoiDustDistribution classes are very similar to
those described for radiation sources respectively in \ref HydroSourcesAmrSnapshot and \ref HydroSourcesVoroLoadsnap.
The properties determining the %SED for radiation sources are in this case replaced by the gas density
\f$\rho_\mathrm{gas}\f$ and metallicity \f$Z\f$.

Alternatively, we can configure an instance of the AdaptiveMeshGeometry or VoronoiGeometry} classes, which normalize
the total weight of the density distribution to unity, so that we need to supply the total dust mass through one of the
standard normalization mechanisms offered by SKIRT.

\subsubsection HydroDustGridConfig Configuring the RT dust grid

For grid-based hydrodynamical snapshots, SKIRT offers the option to perform the RT simulation using the imported grid
(see the AdaptiveMeshDustGrid class). In this case, rather than constructing a RT dust grid using some configured
scheme based on sampling the density in the imported distribution, SKIRT directly adopts the grid on which the snapshot
has been defined. However, while this seems a logical thing to do, it is often not the best choice for several reasons.

Most importantly, the resolution requirements for the RT treatment usually differ from those for the hydrodynamical
simulation. We might not need the same overall resolution, and fine-grained cells may be needed in different areas of
the domain. Also, sometimes the SKIRT dust grid can be made smaller than the full snapshot domain, cutting off the
outer areas that do not contain significant amounts of dust anyway. And finally, the octree and k-d tree dust grids in
SKIRT (OctTreeDustGrid and BinTreeDustGrid) are highly optimized for photon package shooting, so the grid construction
time is usually easily regained during the actual RT simulation phase.


\section HydroConclusions Conclusions

We described the various mechanisms implemented in SKIRT for importing snapshots generated by hydrodynamical simulation
codes. We can conclude that SKIRT's capabilities are very flexible and enable RT post-processing of snapshots from
essentially any hydrodynamical code with minimal data conversion and little or no programming requirements.

At the same time, it is fair to point out some limitations. As it stands, several capabilities are implemented only for
SPH snapshots, e.g., support for a configurable %SED family (\ref HydroSourcesSphSnapsed) or for velocity Doppler shift
(\ref HydroSourcesSphVelocity), and other capabilities are implemented only for grid-based snapshots, e.g., support for
binary data formats (\ref HydroSourcesAmrSnapshot). Adding these capabilities for the other snapshot types would be
fairly straightforward, but doing so within the current class structure would cause substantial code duplication and
maintenance headaches. Similarly, the smoothed particle kernels employed in SKIRT are hard-coded and optimized for each
use case, e.g., sampling random locations (\ref HydroSourcesSph) or calculating the density at a given location (\ref
HydroDustSph). Instead, the user should be able to select a kernel that matches the kernel used in the originating SPH
simulation, even if this would have some performance implications.

To address these issues, we should design and implement a cleaner structure of SKIRT's import modules in the future.
