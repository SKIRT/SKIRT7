\section DevBlocks Blocks of code

The various classes in the SKIRT source code are distributed over several subprojects, each residing
in its own directory (see \ref DevDirs), as follows (in alphabetical order):
  - \c Cfitsio -- This library provides input/output capabilities for FITS files.
    It contains a subset of the source files offered in tarball
    cfitsio3360.tar.gz downloaded from NASA's HEASARC software site
    at http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html .
    No changes were made to any of the source files.
  - \c Discover -- This library handles parameter files for SKIRT and FitSKIRT. More specifically, it
    offers the functionality for automatically discovering relevant information on the simulation item classes
    available in the code, and using this information for input/output purposes, such as the creation of a
    simulation hierarchy from an interactive console Q&A session, or reading and writing a ski file.
    For more information see \ref DevSimDisco.
  - \c DoxStyle -- This console application can be invoked from the Qt Creator code
    editor to help streamline Doxygen documentation blocks, as explained in \ref DevStyleFormat.
    The DoxStyle code is completely independent from SKIRT and FitSKIRT; it is included here so that it
    would be easily available to any SKIRT developer.
  - \c FitSKIRTcore -- This library provides the core FitSKIRT functionality, connecting
    the genetic algorithm mechanism with the SKIRT capabilities.
  - \c FitSKIRTmain -- This is the FitSKIRT console application. It handles the command
    line arguments and links in everything else from other libraries.
  - \c Fundamentals -- This library offers generic functionality that is essentially
    unrelated to SKIRT and FitSKIRT. Most items are fully defined
    in their respective header files to optimize performance.
  - \c GAlib -- This library provides support for genetic algorithm mechanisms.
    The source code is adapted from Matthew Wall's GAlib (c) 1995 MIT
    which can be downloaded at http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/GAlib.html .
  - \c MPIsupport -- This library encapsulates any and all MPI-related functionality used
    by SKIRT and FitSKIRT. Concentrating all MPI calls in this library
    allows all other code to be compiled without the MPI extra's.
  - \c SKIRTcore -- This library provides the core SKIRT functionality
    for setting up and performing a simulation; this includes all simulation
    item classes plus some SKIRT-specific support classes.
    For more information see \ref DevSimItems.
  - \c SKIRTmain -- This is the SKIRT console application. It handles the command
    line arguments and links in everything else from other libraries.
  - \c Voro -- This library provides support for building Voronoi meshes.
    The source code is adapted from the Voro++ library written by Chris H. Rycroft (LBL / UC Berkeley)
    which can be downloaded at http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/about.html .
    For more information see \ref Voro.

The above diagram shows the dependencies between the subprojects. A subproject in the upper box may directly
depend on any of the subprojects in the lower box; these dependencies are represented by a single arrow to
keep the diagram readable. Note that all arrows point down, which means that there are no circular dependencies.
When adjusting or extending the code, be careful not to inadvertently create any new dependencies. In any case,
circular dependencies between subprojects are not allowed.

\section DevSimItems Simulation items

A complete simulation is represented in SKIRT as run-time hierarchy of objects (instances of various C++ classes)
called <em>simulation items</em>. The following diagram presents a simple run-time simulation hierarchy
(a connection starting with a diamond loosely means "A owns B"):

\dot
digraph runtime {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=rect, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10];
    edge [dir=back arrowtail=ediamond];

    OligoMonteCarloSimulation [label="OligoMonteCarloSimulation" URL="\ref OligoMonteCarloSimulation"];
      Parallel [label="Parallel" URL="\ref Parallel"];
      FilePaths [label="FilePaths" URL="\ref FilePaths"];
      Console [label="Console" URL="\ref Console"];
      Random [label="Random" URL="\ref Random"];
      ExtragalacticUnits [label="ExtragalacticUnits" URL="\ref ExtragalacticUnits"];
      OligoWavelengthGrid [label="OligoWavelengthGrid" URL="\ref OligoWavelengthGrid"];
      StellarSystem [label="StellarSystem" URL="\ref StellarSystem"];
        SPHStellarComp [label="SPHStellarComp" URL="\ref SPHStellarComp"];
      OligoDustSystem [label="OligoDustSystem" URL="\ref OligoDustSystem"];
        SPHDustDistribution [label="SPHDustDistribution" URL="\ref SPHDustDistribution"];
          InterstellarDustMix [label="InterstellarDustMix" URL="\ref InterstellarDustMix"];
        OctTreeDustGridStructure [label="OctTreeDustGridStructure" URL="\ref OctTreeDustGridStructure"];
      InstrumentSystem [label="InstrumentSystem" URL="\ref InstrumentSystem"];
        SimpleInstrument_1 [label="SimpleInstrument_1" URL="\ref SimpleInstrument"];
        SimpleInstrument_2 [label="SimpleInstrument_2" URL="\ref SimpleInstrument"];
        SimpleInstrument_3 [label="SimpleInstrument_3" URL="\ref SimpleInstrument"];

      OligoMonteCarloSimulation -> Parallel;
      OligoMonteCarloSimulation -> FilePaths;
      OligoMonteCarloSimulation -> Console;
      OligoMonteCarloSimulation -> Random;
      OligoMonteCarloSimulation -> ExtragalacticUnits;
      OligoMonteCarloSimulation -> OligoWavelengthGrid;
      OligoMonteCarloSimulation -> StellarSystem;
        StellarSystem -> SPHStellarComp;
      OligoMonteCarloSimulation -> OligoDustSystem;
        OligoDustSystem -> SPHDustDistribution;
          SPHDustDistribution -> InterstellarDustMix;
        OligoDustSystem -> OctTreeDustGridStructure;
      OligoMonteCarloSimulation -> InstrumentSystem;
        InstrumentSystem -> SimpleInstrument_1;
        InstrumentSystem -> SimpleInstrument_2;
        InstrumentSystem -> SimpleInstrument_3;
}
\enddot

A run-time simulation hierarchy includes the following information:
  - the configuration of the simulation, including all parameters, represented by a combination of:
      - the structural makeup of the hierarchy
      - the selection of the type of simulation items actually included (e.g. OctTreeDustGridStructure rather than
        another type of dust grid)
      - the properties of the various simulation items (not shown in the diagram)
  - the functionality needed to perform the simulation and output the results, embodied in the code associated with
    each specific simulation item class
  - the run-time data needed and/or generated while performing the simulation, represented by data members in
    each of the simulation items.

Multiple run-time simulation hierarchies can co-exist and are independent of each other. There is no shared or
global data, except when accessing truly global resources (such as the console) which are protected by
appropriate locking mechanisms. Also see \ref DevStyleFiles.

The contents of a ski file mimics the corresponding run-time simulation hierarchy (see \ref UserSKIStruct) with
the exception of the Parallel, FilePaths and Log (Console) objects, which are configured in the \c SKIRTmain code
as determined by the command line arguments.

\section DevSimClasses Simulation item classes

A simulation item is an instance of a C++ class that inherits the SimulationItem class. The following diagram
presents a small part of the inheritance tree:

\dot
digraph inheritance {
    rankdir=BT;
    node [shape=rect, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10];
    edge [arrowhead=empty];

    SimulationItem [label="SimulationItem" URL="\ref SimulationItem"];
      StellarComp [label="StellarComp" URL="\ref StellarComp"];
        SPHStellarComp [label="SPHStellarComp" URL="\ref SPHStellarComp"];
        OtherStellarComp [label="..."];
      Simulation [label="Simulation" URL="\ref Simulation"];
        MonteCarloSimulation [label="MonteCarloSimulation" URL="\ref MonteCarloSimulation"];
          OligoMonteCarloSimulation [label="OligoMonteCarloSimulation" URL="\ref OligoMonteCarloSimulation"];
          OtherMonteCarloSimulation [label="..."];
      Log [label="Log" URL="\ref Log"];
        Console [label="Console" URL="\ref Console"];
        FileLog [label="FileLog" URL="\ref FileLog"];

      StellarComp -> SimulationItem;
        SPHStellarComp -> StellarComp;
        OtherStellarComp -> StellarComp;
      Simulation -> SimulationItem;
        MonteCarloSimulation -> Simulation;
          OligoMonteCarloSimulation -> MonteCarloSimulation;
          OtherMonteCarloSimulation -> MonteCarloSimulation;
      Log -> SimulationItem;
        Console -> Log;
        FileLog -> Log;
}
\enddot

The leaf nodes represent concrete simulation item classes. Instances of these classes can be part of a run-time
simulation hierarchy. The non-leaf nodes represent abstract simulation item classes that can't be instantiated.

Thus simulation items form a compile-time class hierarchy through inheritance (with the SimulationItem class
at the top), and a run-time object hierarchy through pointers (with an instance of a Simulation subclass at the top).

The basic interface inherited from SimulationItem facilitates common functionality for working with simulation items.
For example, the SimulationItem::find() function allows locating a simulation item in a run-time simulation hierarchy
simply providing its class name. Also, the Simulation class cooperates with the SimulationItem interface to
setup and run a complete simulation.

\section DevSimDisco Discovery of simulation items

The code residing in the \c Discover directory provides automatic discovery of compile-time information on the
available simulation item classes and their properties. Based on this functionality, the code offers various
interfaces to the outside world. These interfaces automatically adjust when new simulation item classes
or properties are added to the code. Currently the code supports:
 - creating a simulation hierarchy based on user responses during an interactive console Q&A session,
 - saving or loading a simulation hierarchy to and from a ski file (in XML format),
 - generating a human-readable report summarizing the simulation parameters for a simulation hierarchy.

The discovery mechanism allows all information about a simulation item class to be defined in a single place,
i.e. in the simulation item class declaration and implementation. The interfaces described above have no built-in
knowledge about specific simulation item classes, which means that they self-adjust to changes in the code.

Specifically this means that:
 - When adding a new simulation item class, there is no need to add code in each of the interfaces separately;
   the same basic information (included in the simulation item class declaration) is used by all interfaces.
 - New interfaces (such as perhaps a graphical user interface) can be added later, without changing any of the
   existing code, and without duplicating information about specific simulation item classes.

For more details on adding the appropriate information to simulation item classes, see \ref DevDiscoUsage.

The following diagram presents the relationships between some important classes implementing the Discovery
mechanism and the interfaces using it. A dashed line ending in a V-shaped arrow means "A references B";
A solid line ending in an empty triangular arrow means "A inherits B":

\dot
digraph relations {
    rankdir=BT;
    nodesep=0.5;
    node [shape=rect, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10];
    edge [arrowhead=empty];  // A inherits B

    RegisterSimulationItems [label="RegisterSimulationItems" URL="\ref RegisterSimulationItems"];
    SimulationItemRegistry [label="SimulationItemRegistry" URL="\ref SimulationItemRegistry"];
    MetaObject [label="Qt MetaObject"];
    SimulationItemDiscovery [label="SimulationItemDiscovery" URL="\ref SimulationItemDiscovery"];
    main [label="SKIRTmain" style=bold];

    subgraph {
        PropertyHandlerVisitor [label="PropertyHandlerVisitor" URL="\ref PropertyHandlerVisitor"];
        ConsoleHierarchyCreator [label="ConsoleHierarchyCreator" URL="\ref ConsoleHierarchyCreator"];
        XmlHierarchyWriter [label="XmlHierarchyWriter" URL="\ref XmlHierarchyWriter"];
        ConsoleHierarchyCreator -> PropertyHandlerVisitor;
        XmlHierarchyWriter -> PropertyHandlerVisitor;
    }
    subgraph {
        PropertyHandler [label="PropertyHandler" URL="\ref PropertyHandler"];
        IntPropertyHandler [label="IntPropertyHandler" URL="\ref IntPropertyHandler"];
        ItemPropertyHandler [label="ItemPropertyHandler" URL="\ref ItemPropertyHandler"];
        IntPropertyHandler -> PropertyHandler;
        ItemPropertyHandler -> PropertyHandler;
    }
    edge [arrowhead=vee style=dashed];  // A references B

    RegisterSimulationItems -> SimulationItemRegistry;
    SimulationItemRegistry -> MetaObject [constraint=false];
    SimulationItemDiscovery -> SimulationItemRegistry;
    SimulationItemDiscovery -> MetaObject;
    main -> RegisterSimulationItems;
    main -> PropertyHandlerVisitor [constraint=false];
    PropertyHandlerVisitor -> SimulationItemDiscovery;
    PropertyHandler -> PropertyHandlerVisitor [dir=both arrowtail=vee constraint=false];
    PropertyHandler -> MetaObject;
    PropertyHandler -> SimulationItemDiscovery;
}
\enddot

The discovery mechanism heavily uses the Qt meta object mechanism, which is centered around the QObject and
QMetaObject classes (refer to the Qt documentation). It includes the following components:
 - SimulationItemRegistry keeps track of all available simulation items, including the abstract
   classes in the inheritance tree.
 - RegisterSimulationItems has a single function that adds the available classes to the registry. It is provided as
   a seperate file so that it would be easy to locate and edit when a new simulation item class is added to the code.
 - SimulationItemDiscovery does the ground work of extracting the relevant information from the compile-time
   data structures provided by the Qt meta object mechanism.
 - PropertyHandler subclasses handle simulation item properties, i.e. the values of the simulation parameters.
   There is a subclass for each property type, including value types such as integer or string, and
   pointer types that reference another simulation item or a list of items.
 - PropertyHandlerVisitor subclasses implement the interfaces described above.

The abstract classes PropertyHandler and PropertyHandlerVisitor, and their subclasses, cooperate according to the
<em>visitor design pattern</em> (see the literature or the web for more information on this pattern). This enables
each of the interfaces to visit (i.e. iterate over) the properties of all simulation items in a runtime simulation
hierarchy in a type-safe way, based on the discovered compile-time information.

The code in the \c SKIRTmain block first adds all known simulation items to the SimulationItemRegistry.
It then uses one of the PropertyHandlerVisitor subclasses, for example ConsoleHierarchyCreator, to create a
runtime simulation hierarchy which it then asks to actually perform the simulation. The \c SKIRTmain code can use
XmlHierarchyWriter, another PropertyHandlerVisitor subclass, to store the simulation parameters in a ski file.
