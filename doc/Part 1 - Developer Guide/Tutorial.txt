In this tutorial, you will extend the SKIRT code with a new geometry that can be used for stellar and
dust density distributions.
Before starting this tutorial, you should have installed the development environment and built the SKIRT code
as described in the \ref InstallationGuide. You should also know how to use SKIRT as described in the \ref UsersGuide.

The new geometry is an isothermal disk with the axisymmetric density profile
\f[ \rho({\bf{r}}) \equiv \rho(R,z)
= \rho_0\,\exp\left(-\frac{R}{h_R}\right)\, {\text{sech}}^2\left(\frac{z}{h_z}\right) \f]
with the scalelength \f$h_R\f$ and the scaleheight \f$h_z\f$ as two free parameters.

\section DevTutSco Scoping out the work

To add a new geometry, you need to create a new class and tie it into the simulation item class hierarchy.
Rather than reinventing the wheel, browse the SKIRT documentation and look for an existing class with properties
simular to your needs. It so happens that the ExpDiskGeometry class also defines an axisymmetric dust disk.
To examine it more closely, open the \c ExpDiskGeometry.hpp header file in the code editor.

It appears that ExpDiskGeometry inherits from SepAxGeometry, an abstract class representing axisymmetric
dust geometries where the density is a separable function of \f$R\f$ and \f$z\f$.
ExpDiskGeometry offers two properties \f$h_R\f$ and \f$h_z\f$ corresponding to the free parameters you need,
plus two properties related to truncation of the disk which you don't need but can easily be removed.
There is also a data member for the central density \f$\rho_0\f$.

Looking in some more detail, ExpDiskGeometry offers the following functions:
 - a default constructor
 - the setupSelfBefore() function, which calculates the central density
 - setters and getters for the model parameters
 - the functions density(), randomR(), randomz(), SigmaR(), and SigmaZ() that define various aspects of
   the geometry modeled by this class

Clearly you should use the same structure for your new class. The main work will consist of adjusting
the key functions for the new geometry.

\section DevTutMat The mathematics

\subsection DevTutMatDens Density

The Geometry class documentation states that all geometries in SKIRT must be normalized so that the total mass
is equal to one. Given this normalization, we can determine the central
density for the new geometry as a function of \f$h_R\f$ and \f$h_z\f$. We find
\f[ M = \iiint \rho({\bf{r}})\, {\text{d}}{\bf{r}}
= 2\pi\,\rho_0 \int_0^\infty \exp\left(-\frac{R}{h_R}\right)\,R\,{\text{d}}R
\int_{-\infty}^\infty {\text{sech}}^2\left(\frac{z}{h_z}\right)\,{\text{d}}z. \f]
Using the equalities \f[ \int_0^\infty x\,{\text{e}}^{-x}\,{\text{d}}x
= \int_0^\infty {\text{sech}}^2 x\,{\text{d}}x = 1 \f]
we find that \f[ M = 4\pi\,h_R^2\,h_z \,\rho_0\f]
and hence (using \f$M=1\f$) \f[ \rho_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi\,h_R^2\,h_z}. \f]
The density \f$\rho(R,z)\f$ is then easily calculated using its original definition above.

\subsection DevTutMatSurfDens Surface densities

We also need to calculate the edge-on and face-on surface densities \f$\Sigma_R\f$ and \f$\Sigma_Z\f$.
The documentation for the AxGeometry::SigmaR() function defines the edge-on or radial surface density
as the integration of the density along a line in the equatorial plane starting at the centre of the coordinate
system, \f[ \Sigma_R = \int_0^\infty \rho(R,0)\,{\text{d}}R. \f]
The documentation for the Geometry::SigmaZ() function defines the face-on or Z-axis surface density
as the integration of the density along the entire Z-axis,
\f[ \Sigma_Z = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \rho(0,z)\,{\text{d}}z. \f]
In our present case, we find
\f[ \Sigma_R = \rho_0\int_0^\infty \exp\left(-\frac{R}{h_R}\right)\,{\text{d}}R = \rho_0\,h_R\f] and
\f[ \Sigma_Z = \rho_0\int_{-\infty}^\infty {\text{sech}}^2\left(\frac{z}{h_z}\right)\,{\text{d}}z = 2\,\rho_0\,h_z.\f]

\subsection DevTutMatRan Random position

Finally a geometry must be able to draw a random position from its three-dimensional probability density
distribution. For an axisymmetric geometry with separable density function, the problem is reduced to drawing
two values, each from a one-dimensional probability distribution, in the radial and vertical directions.

The documentation for the SepAxGeometry::randomR() function states that it returns
a random \f$R\f$ from the one-dimensional probability
distribution \f[ p(R)\, {\text{d}}R = 2\pi\, \rho_R(R)\, R\, {\text{d}}R. \f]
In the present case we find
\f[ p(R)\,{\text{d}}R = \frac{\rho(R,z)\,R\,{\text{d}}R}{\int_0^\infty \rho(R',z)\,R'\,{\text{d}}R'}
= \frac{1}{h_R^2} \exp\left(-\frac{R}{h_R}\right) \,R\,{\text{d}}R \f]
with cumulative distribution
\f[ P(R) = \int_0^R p(R')\,{\text{d}}R' = 1 - \left( 1+\frac{R}{h_R}\right) \exp\left(-\frac{R}{h_R}\right). \f]
Solving \f${\cal{X}}=P(R)\f$ for \f$R\f$, where \f$\cal{X}\f$ is a uniform random deviate, we obtain
\f[ R = h_R \left[ -1-W_{-1} \left(\frac{ {\cal{X}}-1}{\text{e}}\right) \right] \f]
where \f$W_{-1}\f$ is the Lambert function of order \f$-1\f$, which can be calculated in SKIRT using
the function SpecialFunctions::LambertW1.

The documentation for the SepAxGeometry::randomz() function states that it returns
a random \f$z\f$ from the one-dimensional probability distribution
\f[ p(z)\, {\text{d}}z = \rho_z(z)\, {\text{d}}z. \f]
In the present case we find
\f[ p(z)\,{\text{d}}z = \frac{\rho(R,z)\,{\text{d}}z}{\int_{-\infty}^\infty \rho(R,z')\,{\text{d}}z'}
= \frac{1}{2\,h_z} {\text{sech}}^2\left(\frac{z}{h_z}\right) \,{\text{d}}z \f]
with cumulative distribution
\f[ P(z) = \int_{-\infty}^z p(z')\,{\text{d}}z' = \frac12\left[ 1+{\text{tanh}}\left(\frac{z}{h_z}\right) \right]. \f]
Solving \f${\cal{X}}=P(z)\f$ for \f$z\f$, where \f$\cal{X}\f$ is a uniform random deviate, we obtain
\f[ z = h_z\,{\text{artanh}}(2{\cal{X}}-1) = \frac12\,h_z\,\ln\frac{{\cal{X}}}{1-{\cal{X}}}, \f]
where we used the identity
\f[ {\text{artanh}}\,x=\frac12\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x}. \f]

\section DevTutCre Creating the new source and header files

It is quite possible to create a new class from within the Qt Creator development environment. However since your
new class will so closely resemble an existing one, it is easier to copy the header and source files using
a regular file browser (or if you prefer, command lines in a terminal window). Locate the files
\c ExpDiskGeometry.hpp and \c ExpDiskGeometry.cpp in your local working copy of the SKIRT source code
(in the src/SKIRTcore directory), and copy them to a set of new files named
\c IsoThermalDiskGeometry.hpp and \c IsoThermalDiskGeometry.cpp (in the same directory).
Do not remove the original files!

Go back to Qt Creator (in "Edit" mode) and right-click on the SKIRT project icon in the "Projects" pane. In the
popu-menu, choose "Add Existing Files..." (sometimes you need to right-click a second time to make this menu item
appear). In the dialog, locate and select the two new source files and press the "Open" button.
In the next (smaller) dialog, confirm that you want to add the new files to source control. Now locate the
new files in Qt Creator's project browser and open them in the editor.

In the new header file, replace the three occurrences of \c "EXPDISKGEOMETRY_HPP" by \c "ISOTHERMALDISKGEOMETRY_HPP".
This is the standard header guard to avoid multiple includes of the same class definition.

In both new files, replace all occurrences of \c "ExpDiskGeometry" by \c "IsoThermalDiskGeometry".

Press the "Hammer" icon in the left margin to save your changes and perform a build. There should be no errors.

\section DevTutDec The class declaration

Since the class declaration for IsoThermalDiskGeometry is very similar to that of ExpDiskGeometry,
the header file \c IsoThermalDiskGeometry.hpp for your new class does not need a lot of work.

Most importantly, adjust the description of the class in the first occurrence of the Q_CLASSINFO() macro.
For example, replace "an exponential disk geometry" by "an iso-thermal disk geometry".
This text will be used for identifying your new geometry to a user, such as when constructing
a new .ski file during an interactive Q&A session.

You should also remove the getters and setters for the truncation parameters, the corresponding Q_CLASSINFO() macros,
and the corresponding data members, since these parameters are not needed in the new class.

While updating the documentation, take care to follow the rules for comments in "/ **"-style documentation blocks.
These comments are processed by the <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> utility to produce
the SKIRT manual in HTML and PDF formats. It is \em really important to write decent comments for every function.
When in doubt about the syntax for formatting comments, look for examples elsewhere in the SKIRT source code or
check the <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/manual.html">Doxygen manual</a> on the web.

\section DevTutDef The class definition

The source file \c IsoThermalDiskGeometry.cpp needs more extensive edits beyond replacing the class name.

The constructor should initialize all data members to some default value, without performing extensive calculations.
Often the constructor simply sets all data members to zero.
Since you removed the truncation-related data members declared for the class, you need to remove their
initialization from the constructor as well:

\code
IsoThermalDiskGeometry::IsoThermalDiskGeometry()
    : _hR(0), _hz(0), _rho0(0)
{
}
\endcode

Note that there is no destructor. This is fine since the class does not allocate any resources that need deallocation.

The implementation of the function setupSelfBefore() must always start with a call to the same function in the
base class (SepAxGeometry in this case). This call can remain unchanged. Remove the code that deals with the
truncation-related properties; other than that everything can stay unchanged. The allowed range for the
scale height and scale length is the same as for the exponential disk, and the central density happens to be
the same as for the untruncated exponential disk:

\code
void IsoThermalDiskGeometry::setupSelfBefore()
{
    SepAxGeometry::setupSelfBefore();

    // verify property values
    if (_hR <= 0) throw FATALERROR("Radial scale length hR should be positive");
    if (_hz <= 0) throw FATALERROR("Axial scale height hz should be positive");

    // calculate central density
    _rho0 = 1.0/(4.0*M_PI*_hz*_hR*_hR);
}
\endcode

Update the implementation of the functions density(), sigmaR(), and sigmaZ()
to reflect the (surface) density formulas derived before:

\code
double IsoThermalDiskGeometry::density(double R, double z) const
{
    double sechz = 1.0 / cosh(z/_hz);
    return _rho0 * exp(-R/_hR) * sechz*sechz;
}

double IsoThermalDiskGeometry::sigmaR() const
{
    return _rho0*_hR;
}

double IsoThermalDiskGeometry::sigmaZ() const
{
    return 2.0*_rho0*_hz;
}
\endcode

Update the implementation of the functions randomR() and randomz() to reflect the formulas derived before
for generating the appropriate random values:

\code
double IsoThermalDiskGeometry::randomR() const
{
    double X = _random->uniform();
    return _hR * (-1.0-SpecialFunctions::LambertW1((X-1.0)/M_E));
}

double IsoThermalDiskGeometry::randomz() const
{
    double X = _random->uniform();
    return 0.5 * _hz * log(X/(1.0-X));
}
\endcode

Press the "Hammer" icon again to save your changes and perform a build. There should be no errors.

\section DevTutReg Registering the new class

Having declared and defined the new class, you must make its existence known to the SKIRT discovery mechanism
so that it will be properly listed when constructing a new .ski file during an interactive Q&A session.
See \ref DevSimDisco and \ref DevDiscoUsage.
Note that this registration requirement applies only simulation item classes, i.e. classes that inherit directly
or indirectly from the SimulationItem class, as is the case for your new IsoThermalDiskGeometry class.

Locate the file \c RegisterSimulationItems.cpp in Qt Creator's project browser and open it in the editor. You need
to add two lines in this file: an \c include directive for the new class header, and an \c add<> statement to
register the new class.

Add the \c include directive to the already long list of \c include directives, in alpahabetical order. For
example:

\code
#include "InterstellarDustMix.hpp"
#include "IsoThermalDiskGeometry.hpp"
...
\endcode

Insert a new \c add<> statement to the existing list in the location you want it to appear in the corresponding
choice list while creating a new .ski file in the interactive Q&A session. In this case, locate the
list of \c add<> statements for geometry classes and insert a new statement (for example) right after
the one for the ExpDiskGeometry class:

\code
    add<ExpDiskGeometry>();
    add<IsoThermalDiskGeometry>();
    ...
\endcode

Press the "Hammer" icon again to save your changes and perform a build. Assuming there are no errors,
SKIRT is now ready for use with the new geometry.

\section DevTutUse Using the new class

Launch the newly built SKIRT version without any command line arguments. Provide appropriate responses to the
interactive questions for a simulation with a stellar system or a dust distribution composed of various components.
The list of choices will include a new item for the iso-thermal disk geometry:

\verbatim
  1. A point source geometry
  2. A Plummer geometry
     ...
  9. An exponential disk geometry
 10. An iso-thermal disk geometry
     ...
\endverbatim

Enter the appropriate choice (10 in the example) to select your new geometry.
Complete the Q&A session to save the ski file.
Alternatively, you can edit a copy of a ski file you made earlier to use your new geometry.

To verify the results for a stellar distribution, run a simulation without dust and with appropriate
frame instruments to generate an image of the flux received in a few relevant directions.

To verify the results for a dust density distribution, set the writeDensity property of the dust system to “true”,
so that SKIRT generates cuts through the dust along the coordinate axes (in the output files
prefix_ds_trhoxy.fits and prefix_ds_trhoxz.fits).
