\page UserCmdLine SKIRT Command line user interface

\section UserCLIOver Overview

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> code is exposed to the user as a command line application to be executed in a Terminal window.
At this time, there exists no graphical user interface (GUI) for <tt>SKIRT</tt> .

The options defining a single, complete <tt>SKIRT</tt> simulation are stored in a <tt>SKIRT</tt> parameter file with the
filename extension ".ski". Such a parameter file is customary called "a \em ski file".
The data format of \em ski files allows efficient manipulation by computers, while being sufficiently transparent
for viewing and editing by humans. The \em ski file format is further discussed in \ref UserParamFile.

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> command line application can be invoked in one of two modes (depending on the command line arguments):
 - In interactive mode, <tt>SKIRT</tt> asks the user a series of questions (via console input/output in the Terminal window)
   and, based on the user's responses, constructs and saves a corresponding \em ski file for later use -- without actually
   performing a simulation.
 - In non-interactive mode, <tt>SKIRT</tt> performs one or more simulations as specified in preconfigured \em ski files and
   produces the corresponding output. In this mode <tt>SKIRT</tt> expects no user input (other than the command line arguments)
   so it is ideal for batch processing.

\section UserCLIInter Interactive mode

When invoked without any command line arguments, <tt>SKIRT</tt> enters interactive mode. For example:
\verbatim
$ skirt
   Welcome to SKIRT v___
   Interactively constructing a simulation...
 ? Enter the name of the ski file to be created: example

   ___more questions and answers___

   Successfully created ski file 'example.ski'.
   To run the simulation use the command: skirt example
$
\endverbatim

The time stamp preceding each line, the version information on the welcome line, and the list of questions to configure
the simulation parameters are omitted here for brevity. After all questions have been answered, <tt>SKIRT</tt> saves a new
ski file (here called \c example.ski) and exits.

So that they would stand out, questions are marked with a question mark at the front and error messages are marked
with an asterisk. For example:
\verbatim
 ? Enter the name for this instrument:
 * *** Error: Enter a nonempty string
 ? Enter the name for this instrument: XY
\endverbatim

Where appropriate, the question lists the range of acceptable values between square brackets, as in \c
[minValue,maxValue]. Often there is a default value, listed between round brackets at the end of the question.
To select the default value, enter the empty string.
For example, here the user is asked to select an item from a list, with extragalactic units as the default:
\verbatim
   Possible choices for the units system:
      1. SI units
      2. Stellar units (length in AU, distance in pc)
      3. Extragalactic units (length in pc, distance in Mpc)
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (3):
\endverbatim

For physical quantities, the default units are listed in the question as part of the minimum, maximum and/or default
values. To use the default units, simply enter a number. To explicitly specify units, enter a number followed by
a space and a unit abbreviation (see \ref UserSKIUnits). For example, the following two inputs are equivalent:
\verbatim
 ? Enter the outer radius [0 pc, .. pc]: 8000
 ? Enter the outer radius [0 pc, .. pc]: 8 kpc
\endverbatim

Boolean questions can be answered with the strings "yes" or "no", or just the first letter "y" or "n",
in lower- or uppercase. For example:
\verbatim
 ? Do you want to use barycentric subdivision? [yes/no] (no): yes
\endverbatim

\section UserCLINonInter Non-interactive mode

When invoked with the name of a ski file as the sole command line argument, <tt>SKIRT</tt> performs the simulation
configured in the ski file, reading any required input files (specified in the ski file) from the current directory,
and placing any output files in the current directory as well. For example:
\verbatim
$ skirt example
   Welcome to SKIRT v___
   Constructing a simulation from ski file 'example.ski'...
   Starting simulation example...

   ___more progress messages___

 - Finished simulation example in __ s.
$
\endverbatim

<tt>SKIRT</tt> can perform multiple simulations in one go, and also supports a number of command line options
according to the following syntax:
\verbatim
 skirt [-b] [-s <simulations>] [-t <threads>]
       [-k] [-i <dirpath>] [-o <dirpath>]
       [-r] {<filepath>}*
\endverbatim

- The -b option forces brief console logging, i.e. only success and error messages are shown rather than all progress
messages. If there are multiple parallel simulations (see the -s option), the -b option is turned on automatically
to avoid a plethora of randomly intermixing messages. If there is only one simulation at a time, the console shows
all messages unless the -b option is present. In any case, the complete log output for each simulation is always
written to a file in the output directory.

- The -s option specifies the number of simulations to be executed in parallel. The default value is one.

- The -t option specifies the number of parallel threads for each simulation. The default value is the number
of logical cores on the computer running <tt>SKIRT</tt>. Note that <tt>SKIRT</tt> is not always able to correctly determine this number,
so it is good to keep an eye on it.

- The -k option causes the simulation input/output paths to be relative to the ski file being processed, rather than
to the current directory. This is useful, for example, when processing multiple ski files organized in a nested
directory hierarchy (see the -r option).

- The -i option specifies the absolute or relative path for simulation input files.

- The -o option specifies the absolute or relative path for simulation output files.

- The -r option causes recursive directory descent for all specified \<filepath\> arguments, in other words
all directories inside the specified base paths are searched for the specified filename (or filename pattern).

In the simplest case, a \<filepath\> argument specifies the relative or absolute file path for a
single ski file, with or without the ".ski" filename extension. However the filename (\em not the base path)
may also contain ? and * wildcards forming a pattern to match multiple files. If the -r option
is present, all directories recursively nested within the base path are searched as well, using
the same filename pattern. If the filename contains wildcards or the -r option is present (in
other words, if the filepath may match multiple files) the ".ski" filename extension is not automatically added.

\note Filepaths containing wildcards should be enclosed in quotes on the command
line to avoid expansion of the wildcard pattern by the shell.

For example, to process all "test" \em ski files inside the "geometry" directory hierarchy, one
could specify:

    skirt -s 4 -t 1 -r "/root-test-file-path/geometry/test*.ski"

When invoked with invalid command line arguments, <tt>SKIRT</tt> prints a brief help message.

\section UserCLIOutput Output files

A typical simulation run produces quite a few output files. The precise list depends on the contents of the \em ski file.
However all output filenames for a particular simulation start with the name of the ski file (plus an underscore).

Three "standard" files are always generated for every simulation (assuming a ski file named \c example.ski):

 - \c example_log.txt contains the complete progress log for the simulation, including all messages
   even if the -b option is turned on. It is a plain text file using UTF-8 encoding (i.e. essentially
   a plain ASCII text file).
 - \c example_parameters.xml contains a version of the <tt>SKIRT</tt> parameter file corresponding to the simulation,
   in the format described in \ref UserParamFile.
   The parameter file is regenerated after the incoming \em ski file has been interpreted by <tt>SKIRT</tt>, eliminating any
   ambiguities. For example, any parameters that were omitted from the incoming \em ski file will be added to the
   generated parameter file with the default value used for the simulation. To avoid confusion, the generated
   parameter file does not have the ".ski" filename extension. However the file can be renamed (possibly after
   manual editing) to serve as a regular ski file.
 - \c example_parameters.tex contains a TeX "printout" of the contents of the <tt>SKIRT</tt> parameter file
   corresponding to the simulation. Using a regular TeX installation, this file can be easily processed into
   a nicely formatted document.

Many of the other output files are described in the tutorials later in this chapter.
