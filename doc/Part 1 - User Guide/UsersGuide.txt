\note The instructions in this chapter assume that you have installed <tt>SKIRT</tt> on your computer as explained in
the \ref InstallationGuide, and that you have added <tt>SKIRT</tt> to your \c PATH.

\section UserSKIRT SKIRT's user guide

This guide explains how to run a <tt>SKIRT</tt> simulation and what output to expect.
After a general description of the command line user interface and the <tt>SKIRT</tt> parameter file format, tutorials
walk you through a couple simple simulations step by step, including an overview of the generated output.
More information on a specific <tt>SKIRT</tt> parameter, or on the output file(s) generated by a particular parameter choice,
can be found in the documentation for the C++ class implementing the parameter. As explained in \ref UserSKIEdit,
the class name (and hence the corresponding documentation) is fairly easy to locate even for a non-developer.

The user guide for <tt>SKIRT</tt> consists of the following topics:

- \subpage UserCmdLine
- \subpage UserMakeUp
- \subpage UserParamFile
- \subpage UserTut1
- \subpage UserTut2
- \subpage UserTut3
- \subpage UserMPI
- \subpage UserHPC

\section UserFitSKIRT FitSKIRT's user guide

This guide will explain how to setup and use the FitSKIRT code to determine the best fitting model to one or more
images. It is important to notice that at this point FitSKIRT can only be used with oligochromatic SKIRT simulations no
further than 3~4 micron. The first section describes the general outline to setup a FitSKIRT simulation, some rules to
fine-tune the code in order to get the best result and an example of how to use the code on the VSC-HPC cluster.
The second section is a step-by-step tutorial for NGC4013 that uses the results from the 
<a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be/pts/_fit_s_k_i_r_t_guide.html">PTS data reduction tutorial</a>. If it is the first time you use
FitSKIRT, it is recommended to first follow that PTS tutorial to make sure the data are reduced to the right format. At
this step, you should also have determined the FWHM of the PSF in every frame, know the pixelscale of your frames and
have an estimate on the distance of your object.
